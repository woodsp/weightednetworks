Four easy steps to success:

1.) Assemble unweighted webs and body sizes for each node (SW).

2.) Estimate link weights based on body size (RW & SW).

3.) Determine relationship between TL predicted by weighted network vs TL predicted by dN15 (JY, SW).

4.) Dirichlet distribution per consumer (JY).
